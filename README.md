# Final Project - Autonomous Road Navigation with Nvidia JetBot

# Introduction:
This project is about enhancing autonomous navigation using the NVIDIA JetBot platform. Our objective is to empower the JetBot to autonomously navigate lanes, evade obstacles, and optimize speed, thereby advancing transportation safety and efficiency.



# Data Collection: 
To optimize path following, we meticulously collected approximately 350 images, thoroughly covering every lane corner. This diverse dataset includes straight stretches and sharp turns, enhancing path optimization during model training.


# Method:
Our methodology begins with comprehensive data collection using the high-resolution camera on the JetBot. We systematically capture diverse real-world scenarios, including various road conditions, lane setups, and obstacles. Each image provides crucial insights into navigation intricacies.


Enhancement: Additionally, to enhance speed optimization, we introduce a novel speed equation derived from real-world data. Analyzing lane curvature, obstacle proximity, and environmental conditions, we create a dynamic equation governing the JetBot's speed adjustment, crucial for achieving seamless navigation.

# Results:
Rigorous experimentation is fundamental to our evaluation process. We meticulously measure our autonomous navigation system's performance across various metrics, including path accuracy, obstacle detection, and speed optimization. Validating its robustness and efficacy in diverse real-world scenarios confirms its ability to navigate complex environments.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, our methodology, driven by thorough data collection, intensive model training, and inventive speed equation formulation, results in a robust autonomous navigation system for the NVIDIA JetBot. Leveraging real-world data and advanced machine learning, we enable the JetBot to autonomously navigate lanes, avoid obstacles, and optimize speed. This advancement not only pushes autonomous navigation forward but also enhances transportation safety and efficiency.
